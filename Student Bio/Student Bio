    Hello and thank you for navigating to my Student Bio. My name is Sabrina and I have 
    worked in the Pharmaceutical Industry for 10 years. I have helped patients across 14 different 
    states and 4 time zones! Recently I was laid off from my pharmaceutical technology position 
    along with 181 other people. This allowed me to refocus on what I wanted to pursue aside
    from Learning & Development roles and Medication Therapy Management Roles. 
    I always loved the idea of coding and now I get a chance to pursue it! 
    If I can leave you with a beautiful thought it is this:
    A job does not define your value and it cannot be taken 
    away by a position either. 
    Never live life in fear or worry, 
    you have a purpose.
