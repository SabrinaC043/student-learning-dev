# üìñ Create a New GitHub Repository

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a new GitHub repository and add an HTML file to it.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a new repository named `first-day-repo` using the GitHub user interface.

* It's done when I have cloned the `first-day-repo` to my local machine.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to navigate into the `first-day-repo` directory.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to create an `index.html` file.

* It's done when I add and commit my changes using Git commands.

* It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository. 

## üìù Notes

[GitHub Docs on creating a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

## üí° Hints

What command can you use to list the contents of a directory? How can you use this command to check your work?
The command is ls and it can be used to double check the contents of a directory and pathways. Helps so you can avoid working out of class-repo-pristine.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the `git fetch` and `git merge` commands? 
Git fetch downloads content from the specifired remote repository. Then the git merge merges into new local merge commit.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
