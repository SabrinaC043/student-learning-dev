// What is a symbol data type? 
// Answer: It does not have a short hand and has to be wrritten out as Symbol () every time. The main purpose for symbols is to use them as an identifier
// in object properies. This is the data types only purpse. It creates a diff number for each symbol so even if they have the same information, the values are different. 


//  A primitive Data Type is all types except objects define immutable values they cannot be changed. True/False. 
//  Introduced in JS ES6 
//  Unique Identifiers 
//  Cannot be recreated



// BigInt is a numeric primitive in JS. It represents integers with WebGLShaderPrecisionFormat. //
// You can store and operate on integers beyond the integer limit for SVGAnimatedNumberList. //
// Symbol type is a unique and immutable primitive value ad may be used as the key of an Object Property.
